# Credit-Card-default-Prediction

This project aims at developing a classification model to predict payment default of Taiwanese credit clients using their financial records spanning over 6 months (April 2005 - September 2005) consisting of over 25 financial credit card metrics.

I have used Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM and a Boosted version of the ensemble algorithms to get the desired models.
