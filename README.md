# Vehicle Insurance - Customer response prediction

This Project aims at building a classification model for an insurance company to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will be interested in buying the Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

I have used 10 features providng information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage) and Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) to predict customer response.
